## About Me

I am a Computer Science Engineering student with hands-on experience in full-stack web development.  
My primary focus lies in backend development, where I build secure, scalable, and well-structured applications.

I have practical experience working with RESTful APIs, authentication systems, and deployment workflows.  
Currently, I am strengthening my knowledge in backend architecture, API security, and system design fundamentals.
